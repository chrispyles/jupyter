_Collection of Data Science Projects by Christopher Pyles_

This repository contains a collection of data-oriented projects that I work on in my spare time. As of now, most of the notebooks are written in Python, although the avocado classifier has a version written in R. You can see the published versions of these notebooks online at [jupyter.cpyles.com](https://jupyter.cpyles.com).
