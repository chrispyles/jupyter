		<h2 class="anchor" id="about-me">Projects and Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
		<p>One of my favorite passtimes is to hone my computing and data-analysis skills by doing some projects of my own that utilize the concepts I learned in my data science courses to answer real-world questions. While some of them are kind-of frivolous (lookin' at you, avocado classifier), they all serve to underpin the skills that I have been learning and to keep my expertise fresh and active. </p>

			<div class="box column2 row2">This notebook focuses on an insurance data set that has information about premiums, BMI, sex, and smoker vs. non-smoker, among other things. In this notebook, I looked for linear relationships between BMI and insurance premiums using the correlation coefficient and I ran an A/B test to determine whether or not smokers are charged more in insurance premiums than are non-smokers.</div>

			<div class="box column1 row3 align-center"><a href="./avocado.html">avocado.ipynb</a></div>
			<div class="box column2 row3">In this notebook, I wrote a <span class="eqn">k</span>-nearest neighbors classifier that classified avocadoes as organic or conventional using their average price, volume sold, and number of bags used. In this way, I got a 7-NN classifier with 95% accuracy, and I showed that the optimal values of <span class="eqn">k</span> were 7, 13, and 49.</div>
