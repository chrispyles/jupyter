# Projects and Jupyter Notebooks
One of my favorite passtimes is to hone my computing and data-analysis skills by doing some projects of my own that utilize the concepts I learned in my data science courses to answer real-world questions. While some of them are kind-of frivolous (lookin' at you, avocado classifier), they all serve to underpin the skills that I have been learning and to keep my expertise fresh and active.

| Notebook | Summary |
|-----|-----|
| insurance.ipynb | This notebook focuses on an insurance data set that has information about premiums, BMI, sex, and smoker vs. non-smoker, among other things. In this notebook, I looked for linear relationships between BMI and insurance premiums using the correlation coefficient and I ran an A/B test to determine whether or not smokers are charged more in insurance premiums than are non-smokers. |
| avocado.ipynb | This notebook, written in R and Python, has a $k$-nearest neighbors classifier that classified avocados as organic or conventional using their average price, volume sold, and number of bags used. I then used the test set to determine the optimum value of $k$, which was 35 (with an accuracy of 94.4%). It also contains a principal component analysis of the data set. |
| movies.ipynb | **\[IN PROGRESS\]** In this notebook, I am building a $k$-NN classifier that determines a movie's genre by analyzing the frequency of words in its synopsis. |
