    "# Movie Genre Predictor\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, I will build a $k$-nearest neighbors classifier that will determine the genre of a movie based on its synopsis. The [Wikipedia Movie Plots data set](https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots) is used in order to generate the training set for the classifier, and I will build my own test set from [IMDB](https://imdb.com). The classifier will work by looking at the frequencies of words in the synposes of movies from each genre.\n",
