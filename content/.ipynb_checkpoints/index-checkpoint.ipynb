    "One of my favorite passtimes is to hone my computing and data-analysis skills by doing some projects of my own that utilize the concepts I learned in my data science courses to answer real-world questions. While some of them are kind-of frivolous (lookin' at you, avocado classifier), they all serve to underpin the skills that I have been learning and to keep my expertise fresh and active.\n",

    "| [insurance.ipynb](notebooks/insurance/insurance.ipynb) | This notebook focuses on an insurance data set that has information about premiums, BMI, sex, and smoker vs. non-smoker, among other things. In this notebook, I looked for linear relationships between BMI and insurance premiums using the correlation coefficient and I ran an A/B test to determine whether or not smokers are charged more in insurance premiums than are non-smokers. |\n",
    "| [avocado.ipynb](notebooks/avocado/avocado.ipynb) | In this notebook, I wrote a k-nearest neighbors classifier that classified avocadoes as organic or conventional using their average price, volume sold, and number of bags used. In this way, I got a 7-NN classifier with 95% accuracy, and I showed that the optimal values of $k$ were 7, 13, and 49. |"
